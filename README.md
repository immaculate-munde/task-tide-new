This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

Deployed live at **[tasktid.netlify.app](https://tasktid.netlify.app)** 🚀

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Demo Authentication

The app uses a demo authentication system for easy testing:

**Demo Accounts:**
- Student: `alex.student@example.com` / `demo123`
- Class Rep: `casey.rep@example.com` / `demo123`

**Features:**
- Role switching in Settings (demo purposes)
- Mock classroom creation and joining
- Persistent login state during session

1. Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm): Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You'll also need a package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm. You can download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.
Git: You'll need Git to clone the project repository. You can download Git from https://git-scm.com/.
2. Clone the Repository:

If your project is in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine using the command line or your IDE's Git integration.
git clone <repository_url>



3. Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
Install the project's dependencies using the package manager specified in the package.json file (likely npm based on the package-lock.json file).
npm install



4. Run the Development Server:

The package.json file [4] shows a "dev" script: "dev": "next dev --turbopack -p 9002". This script starts the Next.js development server.
Run this script in your terminal:
npm run dev



This will start the development server, usually at http://localhost:9002 as specified in the script.
5. Access the App:

Open your web browser and go to the address where the development server is running (e.g., http://localhost:9002). You should see your application.
